This tutorial will ramp up the attendee very quickly on the Microsoft Bot Framework, providing a great deal of sample code upon which to base a bot experience.  It will help attendees decide if they want to make a bot to solve a repetitive task they have encountered or a partner or customer has come across.  User experience will be heavily emphasized to create the best bot experiences.  The attendee will get a chance to “bring their own scenario” to work on.  Components will be laid out for the attendee so that in the end they will have a working, published bot or many, by the end.

This is a detailed outline:
1. Cognitive Services Overview
  1. The APIs
  2. Demos
1. Cognitive Services Topic Deep Dive with Hands-on-Labs
  - Topics dependent on interest, but generally cover examples of Language, Knowledge and Vision APIs
2. Bot Framework Overview
  1. What a bot is and is not
  * The major components of the Bot Framework
  * Deploying and working with channels
  * Your arsenal or toolbox
3. User Experience:  Principles and Best Practices
  1. Getting the best user experience through thoughtful design
4. Developer's Introduction and Building an intelligent bot with Bot Builder Node.js SDK
  * Toolbox - Go over prereqs
  * Setup project in VSCode (and set up debugger)
  * Get code from course website with Git
  * Update with API key from Cognitive Services
  * Test with emulator
5. Bot Framework Developer's Deep Dive with Hands-on-Labs
  1. Bot Builder basics (this will be top down)
  2. Getting messages, sending replies
  3. Conversation basics
  4. Conversation model (context/session) and exchange (dialog)
  5. State - the data and its management
  6. Adding intelligence

The lecture portions will be combined with demos and hands-on-labs in Visual Studio and the Bot Framework Developer Portal.  Experience with Visual Studio is highly recommended.  Attendees may “bring their own scenario” to work on during the lab portions.  A list of pre-requisites will be indicated to attendees as follows:

1. Visual Studio 2015 (Community version is ok) (could use Visual Studio Code on non-Windows systems – however most these instructions are working from Visual Studio) - download here
2. A Microsoft Account to log into the Bot Framework developer portal, which you will use to register your Bot as well as to sign up for Cognitive Services subscriptions (if you have Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, or an Xbox account then you already have a Microsoft Account).
3. The Bot Framework Emulator from the Bot Framework Downloads page.
4. The Bot Framework Visual Studio Template (C#) from the Bot Framework Downloads page.
5. (Optional) Github for Windows (comes with Git Shell) or git on other systems to download this repository.
6. (Optional) An Azure account for an Azure-accessible REST endpoint (for registering your bot with the Bot Framework service)
7. (Optional) Developer accounts on one or more communication services (such as Facebook) where your Bot will communicate (Skype is already set up for you).
8. (Optional) An Azure App Insights account to capture telemetry on your bot.
