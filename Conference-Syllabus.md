## Introduction

This tutorial will ramp up the attendee very quickly on the Microsoft Bot Framework, providing a great deal of sample code upon which to base a bot experience.  It will help attendees decide if they want to make a bot to solve a repetitive task they have encountered or they know might be useful to others.  User experience will be heavily emphasized to create the best bot experiences.  The attendee will get a chance to “bring their own scenario” to work on.  Components will be laid out for the attendee and if they have an Azure subscription the registration and publishing portion can be performed (the bot may still be tested locally).

## A list of pre-requisites are as follows:

1. Visual Studio Code (get [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) - learn about debugging bots in [these](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/guides/debug-locally-with-vscode/) docs.
2. Node.js installed locally (get [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) - ramp up on Node with [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBMdkKFn3HasZnnAqVjzHn_) youtube series.
2. A Microsoft Account to log into the Bot Framework developer portal, which you will use to register your Bot as well as to sign up for Cognitive Services subscriptions (if you have Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, or an Xbox account then you already have a Microsoft Account).
6. (Optional) An Azure account for deploying to an Azure-accessible REST endpoint (needed for registering your bot with the Bot Framework service)
7. (Optional) Developer accounts on one or more communication services (such as Facebook) where your Bot will communicate (Skype is already set up for you).
8. (Optional) An Azure App Insights account to capture telemetry on your bot.
