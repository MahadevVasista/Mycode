Developing and Deploying Intelligent Chat Bots 
===============================================

## About the Course

This 2-Day course, designed for developers and data scientists, will ramp up the attendee very quickly on Microsoft's powerful machine learning algorithm APIs as a part of Cognitive Services and chat bot development tools as part of the Bot Framework.  These tools will be called out separately as independent and innovative tools-of-the-trade, as well as a big part of the course focusing on the power of combining these tools to create intelligent chat bots (think instant messaging a picture to get an intelligent caption or annotating conversations based on key phrases).  This course will help attendees decide if and how they want to make a chat bot to solve a repetitive task or clever scenario they have encountered.  User experience will be heavily emphasized to create the best bot experiences.  Components will be laid out for the attendee so that in the end they will have a working, published bot or many.

If the optional hackathon is included (Day 3), the attendee will get a chance to “bring their own scenario” to work on.  

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you will need in order to take full advantage of the course:

Please bring a laptop with internet connectivity.

1. **Node.js** with **npm** installed locally - get the latest at:
  * https://nodejs.org/en/download/
4. **Visual Studio Code** \[recommended\] or equivalent code editing and debugging environment with IntelliSense.  
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/download
5. **Bot Framework Emulator** (Windows and Unix-compatible) installed locally - information and links at
  * https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator
8.  **GitHub Account** - a code repository and collaboration tool we'll use
  * https://github.com/join
*  **Git Bash** - included in git download
  * https://git-scm.com/downloads

We will assume you have already have the following background:

1.  Basic knowledge around using and navigating in a unix-style command line or terminal (for using Git Bash) (good basic guide at http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)
2.  Familiarity with Git and GitHub as a tools for software development, versioning and collaboration. (great book on Git at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
*  Have learned about debugging bots with VSCode in https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/guides/debug-locally-with-vscode/ docs.
*  If you are new to Node, here's a good video tutorial series at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBMdkKFn3HasZnnAqVjzHn_

## Agenda

### Details for Course Modules

Each day is broken up into 1-4 hour Modules, where you will learn and perform labs on your own. Some material that is out of scope for hands-on labs will instead be demonstrated by instructor led labs. The modules, broken up into a general agenda are as follows. The specific modules may bleed across sessions depending on engagement of the audience.

**Day 1**

| Time | Module |
| --- | --- |
| Morning | Cognitive Services Overview with Demos |
| Afternoon |  Cognitive Services Topic Deep Dive |

**Day 2**

| Time | Module |
| --- | --- |
| Early Morning | Bot Framework Overview and User Experience Best Practices |
| Late Morning | Developer's Introduction and Building an Intelligent Bot |
| Afternoon | Bot Framework Developer's Deep Dive |

## Training Objectives
